# Cellinux - In Short
in short, this is an experimental concept app designed to give a simple and clean UI for cellular functionality on Linux

# In Long
i've always been fascinated by the hybridization of computers and cellphones. some cellphones have full keyboards, some computers are made to cellphone like sizes, it's always been cool to me, and i've loved the concept of Japanese Netbooks, these little palm size computers.

this project is aimed at making a simple and clean UI frontend alternative to Modem Manager GUI to intereact with ModemManager backend commands, and make the experience functional, and feel nice, as well as implement calls into one, single, unified cellular communication app. hence the name, Cellinux, a hybrid of Cell and Linux.

i don't know why a unified app doesn't really exist on android either, and it never made sense to split it into calling and messaging, two separate apps, why not make it the same app? well, this project aims to unify that, hybridize it, similar to the type device it's meant to be installed on, and the name.

for target devices, i intend to develop this for the MNT Pocket Reform, and once i purchase one, i will thoroughly bugtest it on that, though i intend to design it in a way that it'll work on pretty much any Linux distro, as i intend to use Java and the runtime libraries for it.

# Why?
i want to blur the lines a bit with this, and do so in a calculated way, with a result that works really well. it'll be weird, and it'll probably be buggy in the beginning as i have next to 0 experience, but i'm gonna try my best.

in the end, i want a mini computer that i can use for all my daily computing tasks, but also have texting and calling. that's been too much to ask before, but as backends and supporting software and hardware have become more available in recent years, this concept is becoming far more feasible, and well, i've wanted this for years, and nobody else did it well, so it's high time i damn well did it myself.

# this sounds weird, but neat, how do I support?
the project isn't anywhere near the level of quality i feel it'd be appropriate to ask for donations, not yet anyways, but any and all pull requests, feedback, and issues opened will help me make the project more reliable, more fluid, and work better, so please, do so, and if you wish to apply to be contributor, i'd love to talk, and you can reach out through Signal. our username for it is on our website, or Nebula_System.69
